    <h2 id="why-are-we-reading-pacifica">Why are we reading PacificA?</h2>

<p>In the <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/apps/mobile/Publication.aspx?id=66814">PacificA paper</a>, 
the authors describe very clearly how to
properly implement a primary/backup replicated storage layer with
strong consistency.</p>

<p>At RICON East 2013, Kyle Kingsbury presented a performance evaluation
of several commercial datastores. This evaluation is specifically
geared toward assessing the correctness of distributed systems in the
face of network partitions. Kyle has turned his talk into a <a href="http://aphyr.com/tags/jepsen">series of blog posts</a>
describing the not-so-encouraging results.</p>

<p>In previous weeks we have discussed consensus protocols like Paxos and
Raft that provide strong consistency to clients and are provably safe
in the event of a network partition. However, many commercial
datastores use some variation of primary/backup replication, and
according to the above mentioned evaluation, do not behave as one
would hope when the network misbehaves. So is there a (provably)
correct way to implement primary/backup replication? PacificA proposes
such an algorithm and presents an evaluation of a distributed log
built atop this protocol.</p>

<h2 id="the-protocol">The Protocol</h2>

<h3 id="configuration-and-data-management">Configuration and Data Management</h3>

<p>The PacificA protocol separates the responsibility for data storage
from the task of configuration management. From the perspective of the
servers participating in the primary/backup protocol, the
configuration of the storage cluster is handled by an authoritative
3rd party (a separate Paxos cluster in their implementation).</p>

<h3 id="replicating-data">Replicating Data</h3>

<p>The server designated as the current primary is responsible for
interacting with clients. It handles all reads (from its committed
state) and writes. When a write is requested, the primary assigns a
sequence number to the operation and sends a <code>prepare</code>
message all replicas. When a replica receives a <code>prepare</code>
message, it adds the operation to its log and acknowledges the
primary. When the primary receives an acknowledgement from all
replicas it commits the operation and responds to the client. The
commit point on the replicas is advanced in a subsequent message from
the primary. This protocol preserves the Commit Invariant, which
guarantees the following properties of the logs on the primary
<code>P</code> and replicas <code>R</code>:</p>

<p><code>commited<sub>R</sub> &sube; committed<sub>P</sub> &sube; prepared<sub>P,R</sub></code></p>

<p>Because of this invariant, during failover recovery it is possible for
a new primary (which is always a previous replica) to bring its commit
point up to (and possibly past) the commit point of the previous
primary while guaranteeing that the operations in its log are
consistent with the previous primary’s state.</p>

<h3 id="detecting-failures">Detecting Failures</h3>

<p>The PacificA protocol uses a lease mechanism to detect failures in the
system. The primary and replicas all track how long it has been since
communicating with the others (using normal message traffic or with
heartbeat messages injected during idle periods) and assume a failure
has occurred if no communication occurs within a given timeout
period. When a server realizes a failure, it stops processing messages
and requests a configuration change from the 3rd party configuration
manager. To prevent a situation where two servers believe they are the
primary, the timeout periods differ depending on the server’s current
role. The primary will timeout if it has not heard from one of its
replicas in a “lease period” of <code>T<sub>L</sub></code> seconds,
whereas a replica will timeout if it has not heard from the primary in
a “grace period” of <code>T<sub>G</sub></code> seconds. If
<code>T<sub>L</sub> &lt; T<sub>G</sub></code> then the current primary
will always realize the failure first (if it is still alive) and stop
processing messages. It will also propose a new configuration first,
allowing it to continue as the primary, which may mitigate disruptions
to the service. Should the primary fail or become partitioned, the
grace period will expire and one of the replicas will request to be
the new primary.</p>

<p>The appeal of this approach is its implementation simplicity.
However, for a short period of time during our discussion we were
convinced that this scheme could result in a situation where two
servers believed they were the primary and could serve (possibly
stale) reads, violating the strong consistency guarantee. The scenario
involved a heartbeat <code>ACK</code> that was delayed by the network,
extending the primary’s lease but not the replica’s grace period. It
turns out we were wrong. A careful reading of the paper specifies that
the lease period is measured from the <em>sending time</em> of the last
acknowledged heartbeat. We had mistakenly used the reception time in
our example, and had convinced ourselves that the protocol was
flawed. While this is clearly our fault, it is a caution that even
simple schemes can be implemented incorrectly, and would probably work
under normal conditions before eventually causing big problems.</p>

<h3 id="changing-configurations">Changing Configurations</h3>

<p>When a new primary is selected it must reconcile the state of the
system using its log. It does so by sending new prepare messages for
any operations that were prepared by the previous primary but not (to
its knowledge) committed. This will bring its commit point up to or
past that of the previous primary before responding to clients,
preserving strong consistency. In addition, the other replicas must
truncate their logs to purge any prepared operations that extend
beyond the log of the new primary.</p>

<p>When a new replica is brought online it must obtain the current state
from another server before it can participate in replication. If
starting cold, this could halt progress in the system for a long time,
so replicas are allowed to join as candidates (their acks are not
required for committing at the primary) while they catch up.</p>

<p>As far as configuration changes go, this strategy appears to be fairly
straightforward (especially after working through some of the
subtleties in Raft).</p>

<h2 id="implementing-a-distributed-log">Implementing a Distributed Log</h2>

<p>The paper shifts focus and includes an explanation of how to implement
three variations of a distributed log with features similar to
Bigtable. We find this portion of the paper to be somewhat superfluous
in the context of the primary/backup protocol.</p>

<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>

<p>The most interesting part of the evaluation is Figure 5. There are two
portions of this graph that sparked discussion, from time 60-90 and
160-300. The first occurs after the primary is killed and the second
occurs after a replica is added.</p>

<p>We were a bit shocked by the amount of time that the system was
unavailable during failover (time 60-90). Part of this downtime is due
to the reconciliation process of the new primary, but we suspect this
is relatively short. Certainly, part of the problem is failure
detection, which relies on timeouts. In this case, the lease period
was 10 seconds and the grace period was 15 seconds. This means a good
portion of that downtime is likely due to the replicas waiting to
timeout and propose a new configuration. It prompted one reviewer to
exclaim “wow, timeouts are a real bummer”.</p>

<p>While the timeout scheme is simple to implement, it also must be
tuned. You want the timeout to be long enough so that temporary
hiccups in the network do not cause undue reconfigurations, but short
enough so that a real failure is detected in a reasonable amount of
time. It seems like the type of tuning parameter that may be hard to
get right. It would have been nice to see an evaluation in which
various lease/grace periods were tried in a failure scenario.</p>

<p>During time 160-300 the server that was previously the primary (and
was killed) rejoins the group as a secondary. What surprised us was
the drop in client-perceived throughput by the addition of a replica,
and how long it took for the system to recover. This re-emphasizes the
need to set the timeouts correctly so that there is not a lot of churn
in the configuration. Even when there is no change of primary, a
reconfiguration causes a significant performance penalty (though it is
still available).</p>

<p>We were also curious about the read throughput in Figure 4. The total
throughput seems shockingly low, but we reason this is due to disk
throughput. The experiment performs random reads on a large dataset,
which is partially contained in memory, several checkpoint files, and
an on-disk image.</p>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>

<p>We spent some time discussing when a primary/backup scheme might be
used instead of a consensus algorithm like Paxos. The authors provide
some pros and cons in the paper, most of which seem to be a wash
(serving reads from a single server, external configuration) or in
favor of Paxos (not bottlenecked by slowest server). The main reasons
for preferring primary backup are simplicity and availability.</p>

<p>The simplicity argument is easy to understand (Paxos can be confusing)
but only to a certain extent. Paxos has become more accessible over
time, with simpler explanations, available implementations, and
variations that make it more practical. In addition, if the
primary/backup protocol in this paper is implemented as suggested by
the authors, then Paxos should be used to implement the configuration
manager, requiring the need to implement Paxos anyway.</p>

<p>The authors make an availability argument (versus consensus) in favor
of their scheme. They claim, rightfully so, that their system can
survive <em>n-1</em> failures within a replica group and still make progress
(the remaining server is the primary with no backups). On the other
hand, a consensus algorithm cannot make progress when a majority of
the servers are unavailable. This is a valid argument if the service
values availability over durability; that is, it prefers to make
progress even if writes are only persisted to one server. If, however,
the service is deployed for durability (e.g. with a QoS that requires
writes are persisted to 3 servers) then a replica group of 5 servers
would have the same availability as a Paxos group of the same size.</p>
