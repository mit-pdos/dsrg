DSRG is a Distributed Systems Reading Group at MIT. We meet once a week on
the 9th floor of [Stata](http://goo.gl/maps/IgVd5) to discuss
distributed systems research papers, and cover papers from conferences
like SOSP, OSDI, PODC, VLDB, and SIGMOD. We try to have a healthy mix of
current systems papers and older seminal papers.

You can join our mailing list,
[dsrg@csail.mit.edu](mailto:dsrg@csail.mit.edu)
[here](https://lists.csail.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/dsrg).
We welcome non-MIT attendees who want to participate. We will also
broadcast the meetings via Google Hangout by request, but we've decided
not to record them.

Email the mailing list or [jfrg@mit.edu](mailto:jfrg@mit.edu) with any
questions.
