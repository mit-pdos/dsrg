DSRG is a Distributed Systems Reading Group at MIT.  We meet once a
week on the 9th floor of Stata to discuss distributed systems research
papers.

We cover papers from conferences like SOSP, OSDI, PODC, VLDB, and
SIGMOD, to name a few.  We try to have a healthy mix of current
systems papers and older seminal papers.

You can join our mailing list
[here](https://lists.csail.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/ds-reading).  We
welcome non-MIT attendees who want to participate.  We will also
broadcast the meetings via Google Hangout by request, but we've
decided not to record them.
