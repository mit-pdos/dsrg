##What is Spanner?

Spanner is a highly distributed, externally consistent database
developed by Google.  It provides replication and transactions over a
geographically distributed set of servers.  Spanner uses time bounds,
Paxos, and two-phase commit.

##Interesting ideas

Spanner uses clocks with bounded uncertainty to provide synchrony between
servers. It also shards an application's data into little bits to provide
fine-grained load distribution. Transactions are also provided to applications
in order to deal with independently managed shards.

##Subtleties

TrueTime guarantees one thing: that the "absolute" time is within the interval.
Since Spanner commits only when <code>TT.now.after(timestamp)</code> is true, we are
guaranteed that from now on <code>TT.now.latest()</code> will always be larger than the
commited timestamp on all servers.

##Questions

* **Why is the write throughput so low?**  4K ops/sec for one server not running Paxos and not waiting for any
  other commit times seems very low.

* **Why is the throughput experiment CPU bound?**
