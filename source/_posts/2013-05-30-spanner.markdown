##What is Spanner?

Spanner is a highly distributed, externally consistent database.

##Interesting ideas

Spanner uses clocks with bounded uncertainty to provide synchrony between
servers. It also shards an application's data into little bits to provide
fine-grained load distribution. Transactions are also provided to Spanner-using
applications in order to deal with independent shards.

##Subtleties

TrueTime guarantees one thing: that the "absolute" time is within the interval.
Since Spanner commits only when TT.now.after(timestamp) is true, we are
guaranteed that from now on TT.now.latest() will always be larger than the
commited timestamp on all servers.

##Questions

Why is the write throughput so low??
