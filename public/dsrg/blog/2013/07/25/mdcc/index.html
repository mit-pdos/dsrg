<div class="entry-content"><h2>Overview</h2>

<h3>Why did we read about MDCC?</h3>

<p>There is a write performance trade off when consistently replicating
across multiple data centers due to the high latency when sending
messages between data centers (often > 100ms).  Existing protocols
use forms of two phase commit which incur 3 blocking round trips
between data centers.</p>

<p><a href="https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/mdcc-eurosys13.pdf">MDCC</a>
introduces a new cross data center transaction protocol for
transactions over key-value stores (no range scans) that uses many
forms of Paxos to achieve one synchronous cross-data center message
in the common case.</p>

<p>A similar system, Megastore, uses per-shard Paxos groups to replicate
between datacenters.  Unfortunately, heavy conflicts in Megastore
reduce performance to around four transactions per second.</p>

<h3>MDCC Goals</h3>

<p>MDCC aims to have the following properties:</p>

<p><strong>Read-commited isolation</strong>: Transactions never read records
that have not been fully committed.  The paper notes that this is
the form that most commercial and open source databases provide,
so ensuring this level of consistency is sufficient.</p>

<p><strong>No lost updates</strong>: This is when transaction T1 reads a record X,
another transaction T2 commits an update to X, then T1 commits a
write to X which overwrites T2&rsquo;s commit without having ever read
it.</p>

<p><strong>Non-stale reads</strong>: Be able to ensure that reads are always of the
most recent value.</p>

<p><strong>Low latency</strong>: Minimize number of <em>synchronous</em> roundtrips &mdash; in
this case to one.</p>

<p><strong>Costs scale to true transaction overlap</strong>: There should not be
large fixed costs incurred for each transaction commit.  Rather,
the costs should be proportional to the amount of actual contention
between transactions.</p>

<p><strong>Integrity Constraints</strong>: Support some forms of integrity Constraints.
The paper discusses FIELD >/=/&lt; VALUE type constraints.</p>

<h3>Key Ideas</h3>

<ul>
<li>Paxos per record

<ul>
<li>Awesome &mdash; could shuffle record ownership depending on access patterns!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Optimistic concurrency control (keep write sets)</li>
<li>During Paxos, rather than propose the new value, propose an <em>option</em> to
update the new value.  If the option succeeds, then a later write can safely
set the value asynchronously.</li>
<li>Move more logic into quorum nodes than in regular Paxos

<ul>
<li>Decide write-write conflicts</li>
<li>Enforce integrity constraints</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reduce roundtrips via

<ul>
<li>multi-Paxos: select master every N commits</li>
<li>Fast Paxos: clients directly talk to quorum nodes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reduce conflicts

<ul>
<li>Generalized Paxos: commutative operations</li>
<li>&ldquo;Demarcation protocol&rdquo; conservatively figures out how many conservativy ops are allowed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Failure

<ul>
<li>Send client state to every node on commit (every record&rsquo;s quorom)

<ul>
<li>write set, xact id</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Questions</h3>

<ul>
<li>How does a per-record protocol affect/enable fine-grained tuple placement?</li>
<li>What to do to make repeatable reads work?</li>
<li>How does Fast Paxos work?</li>
<li>How powerful/efficient is the demarcation protocol?</li>
<li>How do you run range-queries or queries that need indexes?</li>
</ul>


<h2>How MDCC is built up.</h2>

<p>The MDCC paper flows by identifying issues with the best solution
proposed so far, and introducing a new technique to resolve the
issues.  This post will flow in a similar manner.</p>

<h3>Per-record Paxos</h3>

<p>Megastore is slow because it runs Paxos at a per shard granularity,
causing false conflicts.  What if we ran Paxos per record?</p>

<p>Paxos on a record runs as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>up to 1 roundtrip for client to tell master &ldquo;I want to commit my transaction&rdquo;</li>
<li>1 roundtrip to elect master for record</li>
<li>1 roundtrip to set the value (learn the value)</li>
<li>1 roundtrip to make value visible (can be async)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Multi-record Transactions</h3>

<p>The key idea is to add logic into the acceptor nodes to perform
write-write detection.</p>

<p>If I want to commit records A and B, I run Paxos for each record.<br/>
When running Paxos, instead of setting the values in the second round,
send an <em>option</em> containing the record&rsquo;s read and write versions.
If there&rsquo;s no write conflict, the node returns OK, otherwise NO</p>

<p>If I hear OK for every record, I tell each record&rsquo;s quorums to write
&ldquo;commit&rdquo; into their option log.  Otherwise I write &ldquo;abort&rdquo;.  <strong>This
is different than SQL transaction aborts!</strong>.</p>

<p>Also, quorum nodes are only allowed to accept options if all previous
options have been decided (written &ldquo;commit&rdquo; or &ldquo;abort&rdquo;).  Otherwise
write-write conflicts can&rsquo;t be correctly detected.</p>

<h3>Supporting Failures</h3>

<p>The following sequence of actions could block all nodes participating
in a transaction.</p>

<ul>
<li>I send options to acceptors for records A and B.</li>
<li>They accept and respond to me.  The options are undecided, so they can&rsquo;t accept
anything else until I write a &ldquo;commit&rdquo; or &ldquo;abort&rdquo; in the options.</li>
<li>I go on vacation before writing anything.</li>
</ul>


<p>I was the only one that knew what other records were updated in my
transaction!  So the participating nodes can&rsquo;t make anymore progress
until I&rsquo;m back from vacation.</p>

<p>The solution is to send my transaction state (transaction id and
write set) along with the options.  That way if I disappear, each
record&rsquo;s quorum can make a clone of me using the transaction state.</p>

<p><strong>At this point, multi-record transactions using per-record Paxos
&ldquo;works&rdquo;.  Everything after this point is to make Paxos consensus run
faster</strong></p>

<h3>Multi-Paxos</h3>

<p>We still require 3 roundtrips to commit (send to master, elect master,
pick option).  We can use Paxos to elect a master for a block of
rounds which amortizes the cost of electing a master to 0 (assuming
the masters are stable).</p>

<p>The communication is now</p>

<ul>
<li>up to 1 roundtrip for client to tell master &ldquo;I want to commit my transaction&rdquo;</li>
<li>0 roundtrips (amortized) to elect master for record</li>
<li>1 roundtrip to send option to acceptors</li>
<li>1 asynchronous roundtrip to write &ldquo;commit&rdquo;/&ldquo;abort&rdquo; on options</li>
<li>1 asynchronous roundtrip (can be bundled with other messages) to
make commit visible</li>
</ul>


<h3>Fast-Paxos</h3>

<p>We still need two synchronous roundtrips &mdash; one to contact the master
if it is in another datacenter, and one to send the options.  Can we
avoid the former message?</p>

<p>Yes! Fast Paxos is lets clients bypass the master to directly send
options to the quorum nodes.  Recall that the master&rsquo;s job is to
serialize the log entries.  If we want to de away with the master,
Fast Paxos needs a larger quorum size (a fast quorum).  If a fast
quorum responds OK, then the client can consider the option committed.
Otherwise it falls back to normal Paxos with some details.</p>

<p>None of us had read the
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/64624/tr-2005-112.pdf">fast-Paxos paper</a>
so we were ill-equipped
to work through why this section of the paper works. Read below for
how we <em>think</em> Fast Paxos works based on first principles.  Read
the fast-Paxos paper to actually understand how it works.</p>

<h3>Generalized-Paxos</h3>

<p>If my operations are all commutative, I want to avoid the cost of
serialization.</p>

<p>Normal Paxos only allows 1 value update per round.  Generalized Paxos
allows M as long as those values are commutative.  For example, if in
the same round David wants to increment record A by 1 and Jane wants
to increment record A by 1, then the value of A is 2 regardless of the
log order on any of the quorum nodes.</p>

<p>What this means is the acceptors aren&rsquo;t simply writing values
anymore, they also understand &ldquo;delta operations&rdquo;, how they commute,
and how to apply them.</p>

<h3>Integrity constrains</h3>

<p>If I want to support integrity constraints (e.g., A >= 0) the
acceptors need to understand and enforce them.</p>

<p>The paper restricts the domains of the delta operations (e.g., can
only add/subtract 1 or 2) and conservatively computes the maximum
number of operations that are allowed before it is at all possible
(on a single node and any combinations of transactions in a quorum)
that the constraint is violated.</p>

<p>This is useful because many transactions are simply updating counters.</p>

<h3>That&rsquo;s a lot of steps, are there any more tricks?</h3>

<p>We usually want reads to go fast, but if I&rsquo;m reading record A and
the A&rsquo;s replica in my datacenter was not in the quorum, then it
would give me stale data.  One way to get around this is to make
sure the replica in my data center is <em>always</em> in the quorum.  This
works if my data center is the only one reading this record.  For
example, if each data center is collecting the local weather data
and replicating the data, it can be pretty sure that only people
living around the data center will want the local data.</p>

<p>Fast-Paxos is really really bad (in terms of cross datacenter
roundtrips) if a collision happens.  For those cases it makes more
sense to stick with a master and use Multi-Paxos.  Figuring out
when to use each is important.  The paper provides a heuristic that
sticks with multi-Paxos and periodically tries to &ldquo;upgrade&rdquo; to
fast-Paxos.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it!  MDCC collects a number of Paxos variants and puts them
together into a nice cross data-center commit protocol.</p>

<h2>A Note on Fast Paxos</h2>

<p>The following was derived from first principles.</p>

<p>The fast-Paxos protocol was described (briefly) in the paper as</p>

<blockquote><p>Any app-server can propose an option directly to the storage
(quorum) nodes, which in turn
promise only to accept the first proposed option.  Simple majority
quorums, however, are
no longer sufficient to leran a value and ensure safeness&hellip;
If a proposer receives an acknowledgment from a fast quorum, the
value is safe and
guaranteed to be committed.</p></blockquote>

<p>A classical Paxos quorum requires the property that for any two
quorums, <code>Qc1</code> and <code>Qc2</code>,</p>

<p>  <code>Qc1 INTERSECT Qc2</code> != Empty set</p>

<p>For Fast Paxos it has the requirement that for a fast quorums,
<code>Qf1</code> and <code>Qf2</code> and regular quorum <Qc>,</p>

<p>  <code>Qf1 INTERSECT Qf2 INTERSECT Qc</code> != empty set</p>

<p>One of our questions was why a simple majority, <code>Qc</code>, is
insufficient and we need a <code>Qf > Qc</code>. The following is an
example of when it fails.</p>

<p>Safety, or correctness, in Paxos means that &ldquo;At most one value can be
learned&rdquo;.  One example is that even with <em>f</em> failures, a committed log
position stays committed.</p>

<p>Lets say <code>Qf = Qc = majority</code>.  Consider the following logical
proposals and their quorums where each column is the state of an
acceptor (1-5), and each row is the state at one Paxos round.  C1, C2,
C3 are clients (proposers).  C1 commits A and manages to communicate
with acceptors 1-3, C2 commits B and so on.</p>

<pre><code>    1 2 3 4 5
C1  A A A
C2      B B B
C3  C C   C
</code></pre>

<p>Say C1 and C2 happen concurrently, and C3 happens later (as a normal
Paxos round, or Fast Paxos).  Then the actual acceptances and what
round each node thinks its in may be</p>

<pre><code> 1 2 3 4 5 Round (as understood by local node)
 A A A B B 1
     B     2
</code></pre>

<p>Now if C3 tries to set C, its quorum could be 1,2,4 which don&rsquo;t
know that A won in round 1 and B &ldquo;won&rdquo; in round 2, because they
have only seen values for round 1, so the nodes happily accept C
in (what they think is) round 2.  This effectively overwrites B,
violating safety.</p>

<pre><code> 1 2 3 4 5 Round (as understood by local node)
 A A A B B 1
 C C B C   2
</code></pre>
