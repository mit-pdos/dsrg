<div class="entry-content"><h2>Why did we read this paper?</h2>

<p>Several of the papers we&rsquo;ve read recently have focused on
sophisticated, generic fault tolerance abstractions based on complex
protocols.  <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~lierranli/coms6998-11Fall2012/papers/thia_sosp2011.pdf">Thialfi</a>
 offers a contrast: its approach to fault tolerance
is intentionally simple, while at the same time being resilient to
arbitrary (halting) failure, including entire data centers.  Thialfi&rsquo;s
approach to fault tolerance permeates the design of its abstraction,
unlike Raft and VR, which provide general-purpose state machine
replication.</p>

<p>Thialfi is also a real, massively deployed system, but is simple
enough to explain in more depth within the constraints of a conference
paper than most production systems.</p>

<h2>What is Thialfi?</h2>

<p>The paper calls Thialfi a &ldquo;notification service&rdquo;, but really it&rsquo;s an
object update signaling service.  When an application server updates
an object, it notifies Thialfi, and Thialfi notifies end-user clients
on the Internet that have registered for the object.  Critically,
these &ldquo;notifications&rdquo; contain no information about how the object
changed&mdash;-the client has to query the application server to get its
updated state&mdash;-which means Thialfi is free to combine notifications
and to generate spurious notifications, as long as clients interested
in an object eventually get at least one notification that the object
has changed if the client&rsquo;s last seen version is not the object&rsquo;s
current version.</p>

<p>Under normal operation, Thialfi delivers timely update notifications
to connected clients, without any polling (clients must send periodic
heartbeats to maintain the connection, but these are infrequent,
small, and efficient to process).  When a client goes offline and
later returns, Thialfi remembers its previous object registrations and
sends only notifications for objects that changed while the client was
offline.  Similarly, the client only needs to resend its registrations
if they have changed since it was last online or if it was offline for
over two weeks (after which Thialfi garbage collects its state).</p>

<h2>Designing for fault tolerance</h2>

<p>There are a few core ideas in Thialfi&rsquo;s design that help it achieve
fault tolerance.  These are not necessarily unique to Thialfi, but
they work well in concert.</p>

<p>Thialfi&rsquo;s abstraction is carefully chosen to enable simple fault
tolerance.  Thialfi is <em>always</em> allowed to respond to clients with &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know&rdquo;; in the worst case, the client will fall back to polling
the application server.  This is a key choice because it means Thialfi
is free to drop any and all state, as long as it never incorrectly
claims to know the version of an object.  In fact, the initial design
presented by the paper (4.1) is entirely in-memory, yet can survive
data center failures.  At first, this may seem like an undesirable
abstraction to build a client application atop, but, in fact, clients
already have to deal with this when they first run.</p>

<p>Since the only thing Thialfi can tell a client is &ldquo;object X might have
changed&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s free to coalesce, repeat, and generate spurious
notifications.  The only thing it&rsquo;s not allowed to do is drop a
notification entirely.  Since, faced with arbitrary faults, there&rsquo;s no
way to know whether or not a notification was dropped, Thialfi
conservatively generates spurious notifications whenever a failure
<em>might</em> have caused a notification to be dropped.</p>

<p>Responsibility for hard state is colocated with the nodes that care
about that hard state.  A client is responsible for its object
registrations, because if the client dies, its registrations don&rsquo;t
matter.  Likewise, an application server is responsible for
application data, because it has to persist that anyway (and if it
dies, there&rsquo;s nothing to send notifications about).</p>

<p>Regular paths and error handling paths are the same wherever possible.
This means they don&rsquo;t have to distinguish errors from regular
operation and that the code is more likely to be correct (error
handling code is notoriously buggy largely because it doesn&rsquo;t get
exercised).  For example, initial registration, modifications to
registrations, handling server loss of registration state, and
re-registering after migration are all handled in the same way: the
client and server exchange digests of what they think the registration
state is in every heartbeat; if these are out of sync, the client
simply resends its entire set of registrations.  This extends to the
user of the client API as well: as mentioned above, client cold-start
and the loss of version state in Thialfi are handled identically at an
API level.</p>

<p>Ultimately, Thialfi makes recovering from failure the responsibility
of application servers and clients, keeping itself off the critical
path for anything.  This seems simple, but achieving this without
burdening application servers and clients requires careful and
conscious design.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<p>We felt there was one dark corner of Thialfi&rsquo;s design that makes it
difficult to completely understand its fault tolerance properties.
Application servers post version changes to Thialfi via Google&rsquo;s
reliable pub-sub system, about which the paper is devoid of details.
It&rsquo;s difficult to tell how the pub-sub system could fail and how this
would affect Thialfi.  Furthermore, if Thialfi bootstraps off a
reliable pub-sub system, what would have happened if Google had simply
exposed a client API to subscribe to the pub-sub system?  Our best
guess is that it wouldn&rsquo;t have scaled to millions of clients like
Thialfi does, but we can only guess.</p>

<p>Thialfi&rsquo;s approach of signaling rather than notification reprises the
long debate between &ldquo;level-triggered&rdquo; and &ldquo;edge-triggered&rdquo; interfaces
in OS and hardware design.  Level-triggered interfaces like <code>poll()</code>
and PCI interrupts have very similar properties to Thialfi&rsquo;s API
(e.g., like a Thialfi notification, <code>poll()</code> only tells the caller
that data is available on an FD, not what the data is, or how many
times the FD was written to).  On the other hand, edge-triggered
interfaces more closely resemble the reliable pub-sub interface that
Thialfi explicitly rejected.  Historically, level-triggered interfaces
have generally scaled better, and we found it interesting to see this
revisited and reinforced from a very different perspective.</p>
