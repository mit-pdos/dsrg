description: >
  DSRG is a Distributed Systems Reading Group at MIT. We meet once a week on
  the 9th floor of Stata to discuss distributed systems research papers, and
  cover papers from conferences like SOSP, OSDI, PODC, VLDB, and SIGMOD. We try
  to have a healthy mix of current systems papers and older seminal papers.
